## 💡 About Me

I’m a **hardworking and self-driven developer** who believes strong fundamentals are the backbone of great software.  
I take ownership of my work, pay close attention to detail, and consistently push myself to grow — both technically and professionally.

I enjoy solving backend problems, writing **clean and maintainable code**, and understanding how systems work under the hood.  
Whether it’s improving an API, refining database logic, or learning better architectural patterns, I stay disciplined and curious.

I value **consistency, clarity, and long-term growth**, aiming to become better every day — one step at a time.
